javascript

If you are setting a canvas's color style element, it will not work unless you pass it a string of the form 
"#000000", you can't leave out any of the header zeros for any of the red, green, or blue values.

//here is some working code for this:
// #rrggbb (number)
strokeColor(color)
{
    // Create a hex color string with the full 6 characters.
    var str = "000000" + color.toString(16);
    str = str.substr(-6);
    this.ctx.strokeStyle = '#' + str;
},

// #rrggbb (number)
fillColor(color)
{
    var str = "000000" + color.toString(16);
    str = str.substr(-6);
    this.ctx.fillStyle = '#' + str;
},


It is always prudent to test things, such as BVH's early and often, rather than trudgin through manual checking later.
Always test everything possibl before hand.
