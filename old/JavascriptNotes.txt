Always double check names, refractive_index != refraction_index.
Also check scoping of variables.
Watch out for silent undefined variables.

When pushing variables onto arrays, always use array.push(0), instead of array.push[0]. Brackets will lead to undefined errors.

If the problem escapes you, take a break, but look for simple things like 1's instead of 0's.

If you ever find yourself wondering how a function could possibly be undefined, look to see whether you are shadowing its name with another declared variable.
